    Analytics forms the basis of most of the business decisions of an eCommerce business, and Google Analytics is still one of the best. It is easy to implement on any site, and once in place, you can use Google’s Tag Manager to enable enhanced eCommerce tracking. This gives eCommerce store owners a deep insight into how users interact with their site like creating a sales funnel, revenue per product, popular search terms, checkout behaviour, etc.
