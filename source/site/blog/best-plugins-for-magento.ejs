    Magento is a fantastic tool for developing eCommerce sites. It provides businesses with a base to get started on their journey but also leaves enough room for personalizing the user experience.

This tool gives eCommerce store owners deep insight into how users interact with their site like creating a sales funnel, revenue per product, popular search terms, checkout behaviour, etc.
