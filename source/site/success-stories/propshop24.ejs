               <p>Voted Best Speciality Store by Mumbai Boss in 2013, PropShop24 offers its customers a curated selection of fashion accessories, home decor and gifts. They work with designers from Germany, Holland, France, Israel, Thailand, USA and India to curate products from Indian and Global brands.

               <p>Ayesha Alam, Head of Marketing & Strategy at PropShop24, was concerned with how poorly their site search was performing on mobile. “We saw that close to 30% of mobile search users were bouncing from our website. As mobile traffic regularly contributes close to 80% of our revenue, we did not want to overlook this segment. When we weren’t able to improve the search results for mobile users with our then search solution, we started looking for a better solution to improve the search experience,” Ayesha explained.

                        </h4></div>
                    <hr>

               <p>The PropShop24 team was using InstantSearch+ but they were looking for a solution that could deliver a good search experience especially on mobile. At the same time, they did not want the search relevance to suffer. With SearchTap.io on board, the first task was creating a seamless search experience to PropShop24 store visitors across devices.

                   <p>To start with, PropShop24 wanted to show as many products as fast as it could for mobile search users. That would mean that mobile users would not have to keep scrolling to find something that interested them. The team was impressed with the search as you type technology of SearchTap.io and felt that it would be the ideal solution for their needs.

                <div class="post-snippet mb32">

<p>Taking cues from the website’s layout, the SearchTap.io team worked out a design that would work well for both desktop and mobile visitors. This page would support SearchTap.io’s innovative search as you type and language modelling technology that would start showing accurate results right from the first keystroke.

                <div class="post-snippet mb32">

                    <p>SearchTap.io also moved the search icon to a more prominent position for mobile traffic. Having a visible and easily accessible search bar made it so that this traffic would be able to search for their desired products and thus stay on the site for longer.

                <p>Earlier, mobile users also getting irrelevant results due to typing errors owing to limited space and form factor of mobile devices. SearchTap.io’s strong typo tolerance understood these typing mistakes that were common for mobile users and showed accurate results to search users directly. This made a big difference for the PropShop24 e-commerce search on mobile.

                <div class="post-snippet mb32">

<p>To further enhance the mobile shopper experience, SearchTap.io also implemented smart dynamic filters for both mobile and desktop. For desktop users, these would appear on the left side of the search results where users could select relevant filters to refine their search query without even leaving the search page. Mobile users were shown a separate mobile app type interface where they could easily use filters to refine their search.

                    <p>This helped dramatically reduce search load time for PropShop24 and resulted in an increase in customer engagement metrics which in turn led to a rise in conversion rates.

                    </p>

                    <p>“We’re over the moon with our new mobile search. It’s so smooth and quick our customers love it and its showing in our engagement metrics as well. We look forward to seeing what more we can do with this search,” said Ayesha. He continued, “We’ve started looking into our search analytics as well and it has given us some ideas about the direction we will take our store in the future.”
