    </h4>

    <p>It’s taking care of the little things that make our e-commerce search a delight when used.
    </p>

    <ul class="bullets">
        <li><b>Broad Match -</b> SearchTap’s technology recognises that when a user searches for “formal shoe” they want
            to see results for “formal shoes”. Instead of taking users to a “did you mean..” page, take them directly to
            the results.
        </li>
        <li><b>Synonyms -</b> SearchTap allows you to configure alternate names with which your visitors are using your
            search for. These are can be 1-way or 2-way synonyms. 1-way synonyms are those in which one word may lead to
            another, eg. “dark” leading to “black”, but not the other way around. 2-way synonyms are those terms which
            can be used interchangeably eg. “blow dryer” and “hair dryer”.
        </li>

        <li><b>Typo Tolerance -</b> SearchTap’s algorithm does not give zero results for simple spelling mistakes.
            Instead of breaking a search user’s flow, show relevant results. Eg. “sbarf” instead of “scarf”
        </li>

        <li><b>Supports long tail keywords -</b> SearchTap consistently provides accurate search results even for long
            tail keyword searches. Capitalize on the high intent customers that are coming to your store. Eg. “gold
            bracelet with clasp”
        </li>

    </ul>
