                                        We had the chance to have a chat with Saleeh from <a href="https://appmaker.xyz/" target="_blank">Appmaker.xyz</a> who are helping create beautiful native apps for eCommerce stores based on WooCommerce and WordPress. There are more than one billion users worldwide who use a personal smartphone, and every company is trying to show their presence on mobile to reach a broader audience.

                                        Hi Saleeh! Can you tell us about your background and how you started Appmaker?

                                    </h4>

                                    <p class="lead">We started Appmaker in 2013 with a primary focus on converting eCommerce websites built on Woocommerce to native Android and iOS apps. Later, we extended the services by providing the same functionality for WordPress and other eCommerce apps.

                                    </p>

                                    <p class="lead">But the technology solutions were limited. Integration of all essential third-party
                                        solutions for a successful Online store required deep Technology expertise. It used
                                        to take longer to integrate Payment Gateways, Logistics Partners, Email & SMS
                                        Solutions. This deep technology know-how was limiting Brands to try online sales
                                        channels. This is where GreenHonchos bridged the gap for them. We were able to
                                        grow their Online Sales channels and make it a significant percentage of their overall
                                        Revenue.
                                    </p>

                                    <p class="lead">Appmaker is an app manager as well as an app builder. We help manage native apps and can also be integrated into any existing app.  But, whether in a large company or a small business, creating apps with conventional code-based programming has proven too costly, complicated, and time-consuming.

                                    </p>


                                    <p class="lead">
                                        Our tech’s USP is the native app experience at the lowest cost and the fastest pace. We ensure exceptional quality, reliability and performance. We also provide complete native apps with a full feature set, and customers can use the Appmaker dashboard to create and manage app updates in real-time.

                                    </p>

                                    <h4 class=" bold" >What was the motivation you had when you were starting Appmaker?

                                    </h4>

                                    <p class="lead">The beginning of Appmaker can be traced back to our college days. While in college, I and my co-founder and CTO Anees often worked as freelance app developers on platforms like Fiverr as a means to earn extra pocket money.
                                    </p>

                                    <p class="lead">
                                        Slowly, we noticed a pattern in our customers’ app requirements. Most features and specifications were almost the same. This made us think: why not develop an automated platform to ease building native apps? And that's how Appmaker.xyz was born.

                                    </p>


                                    <h4 class=" bold" >
                                        Starting out as an entrepreneur, what can you tell us about the first year you had at Appmaker?

                                    </h4>


                                    <p class="lead">
                                        The first year of Appmaker was filled with learning and facing new challenges. We had no idea of how to run a business, and thankfully we had our mentors to give us the necessary knowledge. Appmaker has been everything for Anees and myself right since day 1 and the love and passion has only increased with each day. Every day was a new learning experience - starting from finding the correct audience to reaching out to them, figuring out a pricing model, and staying connected with them from different countries and continents all day and night. The list is endless. Our effort has always been to keep the customer happy. A happy customer means a loyal customer.



                                    </p>

                                    <h4 class=" bold" >
                                        What were some early learning opportunities for Appmaker?
                                    </h4>

                                    <p class="lead">
                                        One huge learning opportunity and insight for us was that there were no dedicated app builders for eCommerce stores, in particular WooCommerce websites. We believe that every eCommerce store owner is going to need an app sooner or later with the increasing technological dependency of humans. And it was necessary to help out eCommerce stores in building powerful apps which can attract more customers. Our effort has been to provide maximum features in just a click that make an app complete.
                                    </p>



                                    <h4 class=" bold" >
                                        What do you see as Appmaker’s current role in helping eCommerce stores?
                                    </h4>

                                    <p class="lead">To put it very simply, we are helping eCommerce stores shift their presence to an increasingly mobile-first world. Entrepreneurs running these eCommerce stores are slowly becoming aware that a mobile app is a better option to engage with and retain their customers, ultimately leading to higher sales.
                                    </p>


                                    <p class="lead">
                                        But they may not necessarily have the financial capability, especially at an early stage to invest in the development and maintenance of a mobile application. With Appmaker, they no longer need to worry about this. Appmaker will help convert their website into an app very quickly, and act as a technical partner to the store, leaving the entrepreneur to focus their time and energy on other crucial aspects of the business.
                                    </p>

                                    <h4 class="bold">
                                        Would you like to share a success story with us?
                                    </h4>

                                    <p class="lead">
                                        A major milestone was when we achieved 100k+ apps made on the Appmaker platform in the last 5 years. It doesn’t stop there. With the entire teams’ effort, today we are at 200k+ apps which was achieved in the last 5 months time, that’s double the amount in half a year. We owe our success to our customers who have believed in us and stayed together. With currently over 4k+ Appmaker plugin installs, we provide support to 2k+ plugins. We also introduced a new pricing plan from this year and it has caught the interest of a lot of customers. Another success for us is where our customers are slowly upgrading from our lower pricing plans to being our Enterprise customers. This shows their trust in us and we couldn’t ask for more!
                                    </p>

                                    <h4 class=" bold" >
                                        What advice would you give to an online retailer that has never used a product/service like yours before?
                                    </h4>

                                    <p class="lead">
                                        Mobile App helps E-commerce businesses build loyal customers, reduce cart abandonment, increase customer engagement, and skyrocket sales. This is a proven stat. For anyone who would like to take the next step in their business, an app is a perfect solution. It doesn’t have to be an e-comm website, but any WordPress site can be converted into an app. This brings closure to your customers and increases the conversion rate.

                                    </p>

                                    <p class="lead">Once you track, only then you can identify where your customers are dropping off from the website. Maybe your site TTFB is so high that you are not getting every visitor you pay for to Facebook. Or maybe the Cart & Checkout pages are so slow that customers abandon it. Or maybe the Checkout flow is not intuitive.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        With pretty straightforward setup and simple configuration procedures, Appmaker has managed to provide a welcome solution for WooCommerce businesses. With a minimal investment of time and effort, you can get a mobile app up and running. We also think the 14-day trial period provides ample time to get to know Appmaker.xyz.
