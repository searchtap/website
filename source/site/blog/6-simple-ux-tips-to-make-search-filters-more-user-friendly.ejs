    <p>A great way for your e-commerce business to help customers narrow down their search queries is using smart
        dynamic filters. The smart dynamic filters also called Faceted navigation help greatly improve search
        experiences for e-commerce stores. Stores usually implement filters by using product attributes and tags as
        criteria for visitors to use and refine their search. Many customers that come to your store have not completely
        made up their minds about their purchase and having filters can aid them to narrow down to their desired
        products.
    </p>

    <p>If your store lacks filters, then there is a high chance that your customers can get frustrated and exit the
        store. We’ve seen this issue come-up frequently with our
        <a href="/shopify-search" target="_blank">Shopify clients</a> frequently so we decided
        to deep dive into the role of filters for an e-commerce store.

        <h4 class="mt10">How filters can help your e-commerce store</h4>

    </div>

    <p>Let’s start by differentiating filters from smart dynamic filters that are becoming popular with many online
        stores. Most e-commerce platforms already use filters as an important navigational component. smart dynamic
        filters are a subset of these filters which appear on the search results page to help shoppers refine their
        options. Their function is to increase the efficiency of online stores in capturing the purchase intent of
        search users.</p>

    <p>Smart dynamic filters normally appear as popular categories like colour, size, brand, etc. and help shoppers can
        find what they are looking for quicker by allowing them to narrow down their queries. In a way, they act like a
        salesperson would in a brick and mortar store and guide shoppers to what they want to see without the rest of
        the catalogue overwhelming them.</p>

    <p>One important decision that platforms have to make is regarding the placement of the filters. To further augment
        the ease of navigation, bubble filters can also be implemented which are based on the most popular categories
        selected. These bubble filters appear above the search page they provide online business owners with another
        option to quicken the search process.</p>

    <p>While many stores will have the use of smart dynamic filters, their implementation can make a world of
        difference. With that said let’s look at some of the best practices for filters for your e-commerce store for
        both desktop and mobile.</p>

    <div class="post-title">

        <h5 class="mt10">1. Keep filters relevant</h5>

    </div>


    <p>The most important thing for filters is to show relevant information to the shopper. Looking at search terms from
        search analytics is handy in this situation. With this insight, your store can create effective categories that
        will help reduce shopping time for customers. Make sure that you don’t include obscure terms and provide clear
        and distinct options.</p>

    <div class="post-title">

        <h5 class="mt10">2. Remove unnecessary options
        </h5>

    </div>

    <p>It’s important that the filters themselves be relevant to the shopper and their queries. Having irrelevant
        options appearing as filters can often confuse your clients and lead to zero search results.
        <a href="/ecommerce-search" target="_blank">Intelligent e-commerce solutions</a> offer
        smart dynamic filters which alter along with the search query. This ensures that your customers always see the
        most pertinent options and have a pleasant shopping experience.</p>

    <div class="post-title">

        <h5 class="mt10">3. Use collapsible filters</h5>

    </div>

    <p>While filters do help customers, having all of them open at the same time will lead to an awkward shopping
        experience with a lot of scrolling. On the other hand, having them hidden will deter usage. A good balance is to
        keep the most used categories open to be able to effectively promote using filters on your site by drawing
        attention to them. For mobile, this role can be served by pop-up filters that only show relevant fields.</p>

    <div class="post-title">

        <h5 class="mt10">4. Show number of matches next to filters
        </h5>

    </div>

    <p>By showing the number of valid matches for options, you create a sort of visual guide to steer customers away
        from dead ends. This also functions as a way your customers can view your catalogue quickly and get to know your
        offerings a little better.

    <div class="post-title">

        <h5 class="mt10">5. Design filters to fit your site’s design</h5>

    </div>

    <p>The design here doesn’t refer to the visual design only. While it is important to customize filters to fit the
        visual elements of your site, keep in mind to create filters that reflect the nature of your site or the
        customers you want to target. Using categories like “work” or “party” can also serve as a buying guide for your
        customers.

    <div class="post-title">

        <h5 class="mt10">6. Apply filters without reloading</h5>

    </div>

    <p>Long loading times after customers select filters on your store leads to high exit rates. Having quick page
        reload is a great means of keeping customers engaged. While this might seem simple to accomplish, it can be
        quite difficult to implement especially on mobile. Improve search experience considerably with custom smart
        filters that are capable of delivering seamless experiences on all devices and OSs.

        <h4 class="mt10">Conclusion

        </h4>

    </div>

    <p>Apart from being a unique way for users to view your catalogue, smart dynamic filters help shoppers by minimizing
        the guesswork involved. With this simplified shopping experience, stores with large catalogues can use filters
        to effectively direct shoppers along the sales funnel.
    </p>

    <p>Stores tend to struggle with creating and implementing filters. The best source of what sort of categories would
        appeal to your customers can be found in the search analytics of your store.
