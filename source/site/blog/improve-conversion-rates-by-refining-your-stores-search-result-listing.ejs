<div class="blog-content">

    <p>Search is becoming more recognized as an important aspect of increasing conversions on e-commerce sites and
        businesses realize that they will have to deliver fast and accurate results. One aspect some stores don’t give
        enough thought to is how the results appear to visitors using their e-commerce search.</p>

    <p>A detailed and well-designed search result listing page goes a long way in increasing conversions for e-commerce
        stores. This practice of having a descriptive product listing is crucial now when the majority of traffic and
        revenue for most e-commerce businesses comes from mobile. Mobile users often experience connectivity problems so
        it becomes vital to ensure that they do not have to sit through long loading times to get product details.
    </p>

    <p>It is hard to pinpoint what would be considered important information in different industries but here are some
        major features an e-commerce business should include.
    </p>


    <div class="post-title">

        <h5 class="mt10">1. Concise Product Name</h5>

    </div>


    <p>While it may work for some niche brands to use model numbers in the part of the name, typically stores should use
        names that contain relevant information about the product. The name should be representative of the product in
        question. If you are a brand then you might also consider using model names.</p>

    <p class="text-center">
        <small>CoversCart mentions the design name and the phone model for which they are intended in the search results
            page.
        </small>
    </p>


    <div class="post-title">

        <h5 class="mt10">2. Prices and Discounts
        </h5>

    </div>

    <p>It is usually the most important attribute that should be shown in the <a
                href="/features" target="_blank">search results listing</a>. It’s also
        recommended to show if the price has changed because of any discounts. Having a small sticker which specifies
        the discount percentage helps catch the eye of shoppers. Same can also be said in the case of free-shipping This
        removes unnecessary friction between the customers and your store.</p>

            discount percentage.

    </p>


    <div class="post-title">

        <h5 class="mt10">3. Detailed Pictures
        </h5>

    </div>

    <p>For some industries like fashion, accessories, and home decor, shoppers make up their mind based on how a product
        looks and not the price. Detailed images should be able to communicate to shoppers the form and function of the
        product. Stores should also use alternate images on a carousel to show on hover or click to show different
        angles of the product. Some stores are going a step further and showing GIFs or videos instead to show the
        product in action. This increases user engagement with your e-commerce platform and they might become interested
        in making a purchase.</p>

        <small>Hovering over the search results on Jaypore will show alternate images of the products. Some focus on the
            design while others show the jewellery being worn.

    <div class="post-title">

        <h5 class="mt10">4. Other Variants</h5>

    </div>

    <p>Show alternate variants with the product itself instead of the same product appearing multiple times in the
        search listing. This way the search results page is less cluttered and shoppers can find what they are looking
        for much simpler. These can be alternate colours, sizes or any other options offered by your e-commerce website.

    <div class="post-title">

        <h5 class="mt10">5. Key Features</h5>

    </div>

    <p>For some products, especially in the electronics and furniture industry, people will compare features of similar
        products before completing a purchase. This is also starting to become a trend with fashion brands as well with
        labels like low-rise or mid-rise appearing on jeans and trousers to name a few. Highlighting some core features
        of the products in the search results pages saves the customers from clicking through to irrelevant products and
        improves their overall shopping experience.

    <div class="post-title">

        <h5 class="mt10">6. Call-to-action
        </h5>

    </div>

    <p>Including CTA (Call-to-action) buttons in your search results listing is a great way to capture purchase intent
        early. “Buy Now”, “Add to Cart”, and “Add to Wishlist” are some of the most common CTAs used by e-commerce
        stores. You can also have a “Contact Us” button in case your offering requires significant customizations. One
        thing to make sure with these buttons are not obscuring any part of the image or any other element of the site
        like “Back to Top” buttons.

    <div class="post-title">

        <h5 class="mt10">7. Customer Rating
        </h5>

    </div>

    <p>Customer rating provides valuable social proof to your platform. Many customers check how the product was
        received by others having a ready reckoner in the form of customer rating can help influence their decision.
        This is also a fantastic SEO practice and comes highly recommended by many experts. If your site is not getting
        many reviews you can consider removing them till a later date.
    </p>

    <div class="post-title">

        <h4 class="mt10">Conclusion

        </h4>

    </div>

    <p>The goal of creating a superb search listing page is not to overwhelm visitors with information but letting them
        access the knowledge that will help them the most in making a purchase. When relevant information is presented
        in an orderly and careful manner, shoppers can make informed decisions without clicking on each and every
        individual product.
    </p>

    <p>It is generally recommended that you should try and include at least 2-3 of the above options to shorten the
        purchasing process. This will lead to higher chances of your visitors converting on the search page itself.
