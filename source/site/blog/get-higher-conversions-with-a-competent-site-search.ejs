    <p>One of the most ignored segments of an e-commerce site is their search users. These shoppers are generally at the
        end of the buying funnel and they are visiting your platform to with something specific in mind. They expect the
        search to be able to find fetch what results quickly and accurately. Yet, surprisingly, according to a study by
        the Baymard Institue, 70% e-commerce search experiences return irrelevant search results.
    </p>


    <div class="post-title">

        <h4 class="mt10">Search users are your most valuable shoppers


        </h4>

    </div>

    <p>Why should e-commerce businesses care about this number? Because search users are far more likely to convert than
        other shoppers. We’ve seen with our clients that search users are twice as likely to convert. They also
        contribute 30-40% of revenue to e-commerce sites. It would be a blunder to not be able to capitalize on this
        section of your visitors.
    </p>

    <p>The surprising thing is that this revenue contribution is coming from only 20% of site users. A good site search
        experience can go miles in improving conversion rates. From the shopper’s point of view, the time spent with the
        onsite search must produce the results they want to see. If they find the search to be quick and accurate, then
        they will be more inclined to explore your site. Even if they do not convert in the first session, they have a
        high chance of converting in subsequent sessions.
    </p>
    <p>A competent e-commerce search is also able to collect valuable search data from these search queries. Using this
        data you can find out how your users are interacting with items that are popular or not converting well. It is
        also an important resource for future data-driven decisions like SEO and marketing strategy. After all, this is
        the most direct way your users can communicate with your e-commerce store.
    </p>
    <p>Your e-commerce store is losing out on this if you can’t keep search users on your site engaged. While it is a
        tough task, having a well-implemented specialized search solution can make this process effortless. Let’s look
        at some of the ways you can start to improve your e-commerce search.
    </p>

        <h4 class="mt10">5 ways you can improve your site search


        </h4>
    </div>

    <p>Search optimization will be a continuous and time-intensive exercise but it more than makes up for it by
        increasing conversions. With site search being such an important piece of an e-commerce store’s revenue and
        conversion process, it doesn’t make sense to ignore it. A platform has one of two options - either building one
        your self or investing in a third party software like SearchTap.io. The most important factor you need to
        consider when making this choice is the experience the comes with the building, implementing and maintaining a
        competent e-commerce search. Businesses using SearchTap.io have had their revenues increase by 20% within
        months.
    </p>

    <p>Either way, here are some simple tips to help you get started:
    </p>


    <ol class="number">
        <li><b>Easily accessible -</b> The first step for any e-commerce store trying to improve search experience on
            their site has to be making the site search easily accessible. Typically, centred search bars have the
            highest engagement rates but you can try and experiment with how you want to position it. What is more
            important is making sure that it isn’t cramped by logos and is large enough to be spotted by visitors.
        </li>
        <li><b>Faster search results -</b> While many e-commerce platforms use autocomplete or autosuggest to help
            search users complete their queries faster, studies have shown that the increment is minimal. If you want to
            accelerate your search, try implementing search as you type. This will show search users relevant results as
            soon as they begin typing. This done with advanced language processing technology. It can help reduce the
            search time to under 30 milliseconds.
        </li>
        <li><b>Quick refinement -</b> Often a user doesn’t see the exact product they want to see in the results. This
            is when they can use the filters. Traditional filters need the page to be reloaded after applying the
            filters, however, with smart dynamic filters the user’s flow is not broken whenever they apply a field. This
            further reduces the steps a shopper needs to take to get to the final product.
        </li>
        <li><b>Error tolerance -</b> Not having any minor typing errors and misspellings interrupting a shopper’s
            journey is vital to a good search experience. Many e-commerce searches take users to a “did you mean…” page
            instead of showing them the results. This step has been made irrelevant with the technological advancement
            in search technology.
        </li>
        <li><b>Synonyms and alternate spellings -</b> If you have search analytics enabled for your store, you will come
            across alternate terms used to describe products, colours, or some other attribute of a product. Setting up
            tags with these alternatives will increase the discoverability of your products and can also give you new
            marketing and SEO ideas.
        </li>
    </ol>


    <p>Remember that visitors can easily jump to one of your competitors if they cannot find what they are looking for.
        Their expectation of search has been shaped by years of using phenomenal products like Google and Amazon. And
        they expect you to be able to deliver on ease of use, comfortable navigation and rapid results. Your e-commerce
        website needs to have a search that is competent enough to seamlessly guide search users to what they want to
        find.
