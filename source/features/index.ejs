                                    The SearchTap search engine uses text queries to perform searches against data in
                                    its indexes by
                                    examining all words and phrases based on rules of a particular language (such as
                                    English,
                                    German, etc). User queries can include simple words and phrases or multiple forms of
                                    a word or
                                    phrase. SearchTap employs advanced algorithms to rank results by how relevant they
                                    are to the
                                    given search query. <span id="fast"></span>

                                    SearchTap uses n-gram models to help users find results for multiple word queries
                                    that are
                                    similar but not exactly the same as the text in the search index.
                                    Taking the example of an electronics store website which sells many products that
                                    have the
                                    phrase "music player" in the specifications but no products with the term
                                    "musicplayer".
                                    SearchTap would still return "music player" product results for the query
                                    "musicplayer" even
                                    though there is no exact match.</p>

                                    Stemming is the process of reducing words to their root forms - generally a written
                                    word form
                                    and is very successfully used for information retrieval. In order to stem a word,
                                    SearchTap's
                                    algorithm tries to match it with stems from the database, applying various
                                    constraints, such as
                                    the relative length of the candidate stem within the word. Stemming enables the
                                    search to return
                                    highly relevant matches that would otherwise be missed.

                            To counter this real life problem, SearchTap highlights the user search terms within
                            results.
                            Selective highlighting helps users to pay attention to the essential information within a

                        Searchtap uses a faceted search technique for accessing information in large data set by
                        allowing
                        users to find results quickly by applying multiple filters as they search. These dynamic filters
                        are
                        particularly helpful for eCommerce websites that may use search on a number of product
                        attributes
                        such as type, brand, price, etc. Real life examples include the filtering options that appear on
                        amazon.com or Google Shopping after a keyword is searched.

                        The SearchTap search engine adds a unique relevance ranking score to display search results in a
                        particular order. At the same time, SearchTap also allows users to influence these search
                        rankings
                        by "boosting" certain content while indexing or using custom attributes (business metrics such
                        as
                        product ratings, monthly sales, margins, etc) to compute relevance during searches. By adding
                        custom
                        attributes, search results are built and sorted by combining text-relevance criteria along with
                        the
                        custom rankings.

                        'coach or
                        carriage'?. With Searchtap, the results for both these words will be the same. By carefully
                        creating
                        associations between search terms, you can improve chances that our search engine will find just

                            For certain types of search results, the location of the person doing the search matters. A
                            search
                            for "coffee shop" or "doctor" is most likely not an abstract or academic one, but a
                            practical
                            search for an immediate need. Finding a nearby place to get coffee, or a local doctor to
                            consult,
                            is the result most likely to make users happy. SearchTap combines geo and search to optimise
                            search results based on location information and takes the user search experience to a whole
                            new
                            level.
