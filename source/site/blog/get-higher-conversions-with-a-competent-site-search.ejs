<div class="blog-content">

    <p>One of the most ignored segments of an e-commerce site is their search users. These shoppers are generally at the
        end of the buying funnel and they are visiting your platform with something specific in mind. They expect the
        search to be able to help them quickly and accurately. Yet, surprisingly, according to a study by the Baymard
        Institute, <span class="_700">70% e-commerce search experiences return irrelevant or zero search results</span>.
    </p>


    <div class="post-title">

        <h4 class="mt10">Search users are your most valuable shoppers</h4>

    </div>

    <p>Why should e-commerce businesses care about this number? Simply because search users are far more likely to
        convert than other shoppers. We’ve seen with our clients that <span class="_700">search users are twice as likely to convert and
        contribute 30-40% of revenue</span> to an e-commerce site. It would be a blunder to not be able to capitalize on this
        segment of visitors.
    </p>

    <p>The surprising thing is that this revenue contribution is coming from only 20% of site users. A good site search
        experience can go miles in improving conversion rates. From the shopper’s point of view, the time spent with the
        onsite search must produce the results they want to see. If they find the search to be quick and accurate, then
        they will be more inclined to explore your site. Even if they do not convert in the first session, they have a
        high chance of converting in subsequent sessions.
    </p>

    <p>A good <a href="/ecommerce-search">e-commerce search</a> should also be able to collect valuable search data from
        these searches. Using this data
        you can find out how your users are interacting with items that are popular or not converting well. It is also
        an important resource for future data-driven decisions like SEO and marketing strategy. After all, this is the
        most direct way your users can communicate with your e-commerce store.

        <h4 class="mt10">5 ways you can improve your site search</h4>
    </div>

    <ol class="number">
        <li><b>Easily accessible -</b> The first step for any e-commerce store trying to improve search experience on
            their site has to be making the site search easily accessible. Typically, centred search bars have the
            highest engagement rates but you can try and experiment with how you want to position it. What is more
            important is making sure that it isn’t cramped by logos and is large enough to be spotted by visitors
            especially on mobile devices.
        </li>
        <li><b>Faster search results -</b> While many e-commerce platforms use autocomplete or autosuggest to help
            search users complete their queries faster, studies have shown that the increment is minimal. If you want to
            accelerate your search, try implementing <a href="/features">search as you type</a>. This will show search
            users relevant results as
            soon as they begin typing. At SearchTap.io, this done using advanced language processing technology and can
            help reduce the search time to under 30 milliseconds.
        </li>
        <li><b>Quick refinement -</b> Often a user doesn’t see the exact product they are looking for. This is when they
            can use the filters. Traditional filters need the page to be reloaded after applying the filters, however,
            try using <a href="/features">smart dynamic filters</a> so the user’s flow is not broken whenever they apply
            a filter. This further
            reduces the steps a shopper needs to take to get to the final product.
        </li>
        <li><b>Error tolerance -</b>Not having any minor typing errors and misspellings interrupting a shopper’s journey
            is vital to a good search experience. Many e-commerce searches take users to a “did you mean…” page instead
            of showing them the results. This step has been made irrelevant with the technological advancement in search
            technology.
        </li>
        <li><b>Synonyms and alternate spellings -</b> If you have search analytics enabled for your store, you will come
            across alternate terms that are used to describe products, colours, or some other attribute of a product.
            Setting up synonyms or tags with these alternatives will increase the discoverability of your products and
            can also give you new marketing and SEO ideas.
        </li>
    </ol>


    <p>Remember that visitors can easily bounce off if they cannot find what they are looking for. Their expectation of
        search has been shaped by years of using phenomenal products like Google and Amazon. Today, your e-commerce
        store needs to have a search that can seamlessly guide search users to what they want to find more than ever.
