    <p>Mobile is the place to be whether you’re an established eCommerce brand or an upcoming D2C store.
        Some experts even believe that <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20181211005856/en/" target="_blank">50% of worldwide eCommerce revenue could come from mobile phones.</a>
        But with high rates of adoption among Asian and African countries, we at SearchTap see much higher numbers routinely.

    </p>

    <p>In these cases, the importance of having a well-optimized search truly shines. With a good search in place, visitors will be able to cut through the clutter and land in the most relevant pages so that they can make a purchase. Now, this part is much easier said than done. Optimizing the search bar on a store can take a fair bit of time and a lot of experimentation if you plan on implementing it on your own. SearchTap’s guided search set-up has been a big help to many eCommerce businesses that lacked the time or resources to fully implement a smart search on their store.

    </p>

    <p>The stores that generally have the best on-site search experiences create a curated journey for their visitors
        simplifying the process further. This personalized touch allows visitors to explore your store better
        leading to better engagement and conversions. The most common types of customizations you will see range
        from UX/UI improvements to customized filter options. Following <a href="https://www.searchtap.io/blog/10-tips-for-a-better-mobile-search-ux/" target="_blank">our blog on some actionable steps for improving
            mobile UX</a> for stores, we wanted to go into a bit more detail about what has worked best for our clients.

    </p>

        <h4 class="mt10">1. Keep the Search Bar Open

        </h4>

    </div>


    <p>Ease of access is only half the battle when it comes to boosting mobile conversions. Having a minimized search or hiding it away inside the menu creates unnecessary friction in many stores. Save your visitors the trouble by having an already open search bar. As a bonus, you should also include some helpful prompts like “Try searching for...” and include some of your top-selling products, categories, or queries like “blue tops”.

        <h4 class="mt10">2. Add Filters by Concern

        </h4>

    </div>


    <p>

        Having customized filters are incredibly useful for customers and add to your website’s personalization.
        Many cosmetics and apparel websites have seen a significant decrease in bounce and exit rates after adding
        more context to their filters. Visitors are looking for something more than just price and brand filters,
        they have a particular dilemma and they are searching for something that will solve it. You can find tons of
        suggestions for these in your  <a href="https://www.searchtap.io/blog/improve-conversions-with-search-analytics/" target="_blank">search analytics</a>.

    <div class="post-title">

        <h4 class="mt10">3. Alternatives on Search Results

        </h4>

    </div>


    <p>

        One feature that is a must-have for stores offering product variants like sizes and colours. A poor search
        results page would have a different listing for each of these variants making it difficult for visitors
        to navigate your store. These alternatives should be dynamically linked to your inventory as well so as to
        minimize dead-ends for a pleasant shopping experience. The purpose of a good search result listing should be
        to deliver relevant information in the most concise manner possible.

    <div class="post-title">

        <h4 class="mt10">4. Collapsible Filters and Separate Filters Page


        </h4>

    </div>


    <p>

        To make for a more seamless interface for visitors, filters should have their own separate pop-out. Adding collapsible filters when they land on this page will make it easier for them to narrow down on desired characteristics of the products on sale. These filters also help visitors glance over what your store has to offer in just a few taps.

    </p>

    <div class="post-title">

        <h4 class="mt10">5. Separate Search Page



        </h4>

    </div>


    <p>

        Visitors who use search are high-intent customers. Just like having a separate filters page, a distinct page that loads up quickly for search results helps keep visitors engaged for longer. What’s more, is that businesses can also use this page as an opportunity to merchandise their top sellers and possibly shortening the purchase even further.

    <div class="post-title">

        <h4 class="mt10">6. Custom Empty Results Pages</h4>

    </div>


    <p>

        Sometimes, Empty Result Pages are going to be unavoidable. But that doesn’t have to mean that the search user will leave the website. Your store must have a way to re-engage with these visitors. Showing best selling products or categories is one of the best ways to do just that. In fact, sometimes it might help people find what they were looking for even if they don’t find it while using the search bar.

    <div class="post-title">

        <h4 class="mt10">7. Adaptive Display
        </h4>

    </div>


    <p>
        Depending on what you’re selling or even to match with pre-existing customizations, you may want to change the grid search results appear on your store. The best practice is, however, letting the shopper chose what they are comfortable with. The ones that we’ve seen the best results with are the 2 & 4 product grids or the single product display.

        <h4 class="mt10">Conclusions</h4>

    </div>

    <p>
        As trends shift and more people adapt to different technologies, how high-intent customers interact with search also changes. Like any optimization, it’s best to periodically as your customers what they would like to see improved in your store search and implement those recommendations.
