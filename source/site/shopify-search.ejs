                    When customers visit your store, many have a clear idea of what they want to purchase. If they don't
                    find
                    what they are looking for, they are quick to hop onto the next website. If your Shopify store
                    doesn't have
                    an internal site search yet, here's why you should opt to have one:

                        <p>
                            There exists a serious concern knowing what exactly a visitor would search for, will it be
                            'coach or
                            carriage'? SearchTap enables online retailers to create associations between similar meaning
                            search
                            terms, so keywords within a synonym set will return same results. For instance, say an
                            ecommerce store
                            sells bags but only lists the products with the word "bags" in the title. Users searching
                            for
                            "handbags" or "backpacks" would see zero results and leave the site disappointed. SearchTap
                            lets
                            retailers create custom synonym sets that return relevant results, in this case all three
                            search
                            queries - "bags," "handbags," and "backpacks" would return same results.

                        Users often make spelling mistakes as they type and land on "no results" page which compels them
                        to
                        leave your online store. SearchTap's inbuilt typo-tolerant algorithm automatically corrects such
                        typos
                        and shows results for corrected search queries. For instance, if a user misspells or
                        accidentally types
                        “swarowski ring”, SearchTap will automatically detect the typo and still show results for
                        “swarovski
                        ring”. This way visitors find what they are looking for and hence stay longer on a site which
                        reduces
                        search exit rates.
